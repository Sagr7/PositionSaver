# PositionSaver
an MTA:SA script for save and loading position.

This script also measures the map's duration by calcualation the time that has been taken between loading and creating warps, it also saves everything you might need like nitro stats and it's very accurate, so you won't need to start playing the map all over again (HDM mappers can relate).
therefore, it's very useful for mapper as well as map testers.

for now, it's totally client-sided. there is more todo in the future like sharing warps and other stuff.

# How to use:
 Place the folder ```positionsaver``` in your resources directory in ``MTA:SA`` server directory.
